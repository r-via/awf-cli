# AI Workflow Framework - CLI

[![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.24+-00ADD8?style=flat&logo=go)](https://go.dev/)
[![License: EUPL-1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-EUPL--1.2-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A Go CLI tool for orchestrating AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Codex, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI-Compatible APIs) through YAML-configured workflows with state machine execution.

## Features

- **State Machine Execution** - Define workflows as state machines with conditional transitions based on exit codes, command output, or custom expressions
- **Inline Error Handling** - Specify error messages and exit codes directly on steps without creating separate terminal states
- **Agent Steps** - Invoke AI agents via CLI tools (Claude, Codex, Gemini, GitHub Copilot) or direct HTTP (OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, Groq) with prompt templates, response parsing, and accurate token tracking
- **Output Formatting for Agent Steps** - Automatically strip markdown code fences and validate JSON output; human-readable streaming display controlled by `output_format` field (text vs raw NDJSON); unified display-event abstraction across all 6 providers with optional verbose mode showing tool-use markers (`[tool: Name(Arg)]`)
- **External Prompt Files** - Load agent prompts from `.md` files with full template interpolation, helper functions, and local override support
- **External Script Files** - Load commands from external script files with shebang-based interpreter dispatch, template interpolation, path resolution, and local override support
- **Conversation Mode** - Multi-turn conversations with native session resume for CLI providers (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `github_copilot`), automatic context window management for HTTP providers, mid-conversation context injection via `inject_context` field, and token tracking across all turns
- **OpenAI-Compatible Provider** - Use any Chat Completions API (OpenAI, Ollama, vLLM, Groq) with native HTTP integration, accurate token reporting, and no CLI tool required
- **Parallel Execution** - Run multiple steps concurrently with configurable strategies
- **Loop Constructs** - For-each and while loops with full context access
- **Sub-Workflows** - Invoke workflows from other workflows with input/output mapping
- **Retry with Backoff** - Automatic retry with exponential, linear, or constant backoff
- **Workflow Templates** - Reusable step patterns with parameters
- **Input Validation** - Type checking, patterns, enums, file validation
- **Dry-Run Mode** - Preview execution plan without running commands
- **Interactive Mode** - Step-by-step execution with prompts
- **Interactive Input Collection** - Automatically prompt for missing required inputs in terminal sessions
- **Structured Error Codes** - Hierarchical error taxonomy (`USER.INPUT.MISSING_FILE`) with `awf error` lookup command
- **Actionable Error Hints** - Context-aware suggestions ("Did you mean?") with fuzzy matching, suppressible via `--no-hints`
- **Audit Trail** - Structured JSONL audit log with paired start/end entries per execution, secret masking, configurable path, and atomic writes
- **Distributed Tracing** - OpenTelemetry integration for visibility into workflow execution with spans for steps, agents, parallel/loop blocks, and shell commands; export to any OTLP-compatible backend (Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, Honeycomb) via `--otel-exporter` and `--otel-service-name` flags
- **Plugin System** - Extend AWF with custom operations, validators, and step types via gRPC plugins (HashiCorp go-plugin); automatic mutual TLS (AutoMTLS) encryption for all host-plugin communication with zero configuration; SHA-256 binary integrity verification at launch time blocks tampered or corrupted plugins; plugin subprocess log and stdout/stderr forwarding to AWF's structured logger for crash diagnostics; validators run custom rules during `awf validate`, custom step types register new `type:` values for workflow steps; event system enables plugins to subscribe to core lifecycle events (`workflow.*`, `step.*`) and emit custom inter-plugin events with glob pattern matching, per-plugin buffered channels, and cycle detection; GRPCBroker enables plugins to emit events back to the host at runtime via a dedicated reverse channel with manifest-based permission enforcement; persistent gRPC streaming delivers events to plugins over long-lived connections with automatic fallback to unary RPCs for plugins that don't support streaming; includes `sdk.Serve()` entry point for plugin authors, and install/update/remove from GitHub Releases with checksum verification
- **Workflow Packs** - Share reusable workflows and prompts via `awf workflow install owner/repo[@version]` from GitHub Releases with manifest validation, checksum verification, and atomic installation; execute with `awf run pack/workflow` namespace syntax; `{{.awf.prompts_dir}}` and `{{.awf.scripts_dir}}` resolve context-aware with 3-tier resolution (user override → pack embedded → global); `call_workflow` within packs resolves relative to pack root; `--global` flag for user-level installation; `awf workflow remove <pack>` for cleanup; source metadata tracking and plugin dependency warnings
- **Built-in GitHub Plugin** - Declarative GitHub operations (get_issue, create_pr, batch) with auth fallback and concurrent execution
- **Built-in HTTP Operation** - Declarative REST API calls (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with configurable timeout, response capture, and retryable status codes
- **Built-in Notification Plugin** - Workflow completion alerts via desktop and webhooks with configurable backends
- **Terminal User Interface (TUI)** - Full-screen interactive dashboard (`awf tui`) with tab-based navigation for workflow browsing, real-time execution monitoring, history exploration, agent conversation rendering, and Claude Code session tailing; built on Bubble Tea with Lip Gloss styling and Glamour Markdown rendering

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awf-project/cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Or via Go:

```bash
go install github.com/awf-project/cli/cmd/awf@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awf-project/cli.git

See [Installation Guide](docs/getting-started/installation.md) for details.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize AWF
awf init

# Run example workflow
awf run example

# Create your own workflow
cat > .awf/workflows/hello.yaml << 'EOF'
name: hello
version: "1.0.0"

inputs:
  - name: name
    type: string
    default: World

states:
  initial: greet
  greet:
    type: step
    command: echo "Hello, {{.inputs.name}}!"
    on_success: done
  done:
    type: terminal
    status: success
EOF

# Run with input
awf run hello --input name=World
```

## ⚠️ Security & Risk Disclaimer

AWF is a powerful orchestration tool that grants AI agents and workflows direct access to your system's shell. While this enables complex automation, it carries significant risks:

1. **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Workflows behave like shell scripts. **Never run a workflow definition (YAML) from an untrusted source** without auditing it first.
2. **AI Non-Determinism:** AI agents (LLMs) can produce incorrect, unexpected, or destructive output ("hallucinations"). A prompt that seems safe might generate a harmful command in a specific context.
3. **No Sandboxing:** By default, AWF executes commands with the same privileges as the user running the CLI.

**Best Practices for Safe Execution:**
* **Audit Workflows:** Always review the YAML and prompt files before execution.
* **Use Dry-Run:** Preview the execution plan using `awf run --dry-run`.
* **Interactive Mode:** Use `awf run --interactive` to approve commands step-by-step.
* **Isolate Execution:** Run risky workflows or those from external sources within a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker, VM).

                        Infrastructure (YAML, JSON, Shell) ─┘
```

See [Architecture](docs/development/architecture.md) for details.

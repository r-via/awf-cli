## 📦 Shards

Findings are split into shards of up to 10 files each to keep pages readable and avoid GitHub rendering limits.

- [ ] [shard.1.md](./shard.1.md) (2 files — 2 NEEDS_REFACTOR)

## 📖 Methodology

**Model:** haiku

Detects dead or low-value code using a pre-computed import/usage graph.

### Rating Criteria

- **USED**: The symbol is imported or referenced by at least one other file (exported) or used locally (non-exported).
- **DEAD**: The symbol is exported but imported by 0 files, or is a non-exported symbol with no local references. Likely safe to remove.
- **LOW_VALUE**: The symbol is used but provides negligible value (trivial wrapper, identity function, unnecessary indirection).
